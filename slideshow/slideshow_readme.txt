You can change settings in the xml file. If you want to change dimensions, change the imageWidth and imageHeight variables.
The little buttons will automatically choose a new position. To change the position of the whole banner just change the position on the stage.

TweenTime is the time the alpha fade takes (seconds). ShowTime is the time each photo is being shown (seconds).

Enjoy.
